The error message you're encountering indicates that the Laravel application is unable to write to the log file located at `/var/www/html/application.com.test/storage/logs/laravel.log` due to a permissions issue. This typically means that the web server user (usually `www-data` for Nginx on Debian-based systems) does not have the necessary write permissions for the `storage/logs` directory or the `laravel.log` file.

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Set the correct permissions for the `storage` and `bootstrap/cache` directories:**
   
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/application.com.test/storage /var/www/html/application.com.test/bootstrap/cache
   sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/html/application.com.test/storage /var/www/html/application.com.test/bootstrap/cache
   ```

   These commands change the ownership of the directories to the `www-data` user and group, and set the permissions to allow reading, writing, and executing by the owner and the group.

2. **Verify the changes:**
   
   To ensure the changes have been applied correctly, you can use the `ls -la` command to list the directory details:
   
   ```bash
   ls -la /var/www/html/application.com.test/storage/logs
   ```

   The output should show `www-data www-data` as the owner and group for the `laravel.log` file, with `rwxrwxr-x` permissions for the directories.

3. **Restart Nginx:**

   After changing the permissions, you might need to restart the Nginx service to apply the changes:
   
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

4. **Check the Laravel configuration:**

   Ensure that the Laravel logging configuration (`config/logging.php`) is set up correctly. The default configuration should work fine, but if you've customized it, double-check for any potential issues.

After completing these steps, your Laravel application should be able to write to the log file without encountering the "Permission denied" error. If you continue to face issues, make sure there are no additional security modules or configurations (like SELinux or AppArmor) that might be affecting file permissions.
