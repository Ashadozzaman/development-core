Sure, let's consolidate the entire process into a single, comprehensive guide for setting up PHP 8.2 on a Ubuntu/Debian machine, including solving the GPG key issue.

### Step 1: Update Your Package List
```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Step 2: Add the Correct PHP Repository
1. **Install necessary dependencies:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y software-properties-common dirmngr gnupg
   ```

2. **Add the GPG key for the PHP repository:**
   ```bash
   sudo wget -qO - https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

3. **Add the PHP repository:**
   ```bash
   sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list'
   ```

4. **Update the package list:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

### Step 3: Install PHP 8.2 and Necessary Extensions
```bash
sudo apt install -y php8.2 php8.2-cli php8.2-common php8.2-curl
```

### Step 4: Verify PHP Installation
```bash
php -v
```


### Step 5: Install Additional PHP Modules (If Needed)
Depending on your application requirements, you might need additional PHP extensions. You can install them as follows:
```bash
sudo apt install -y php8.2-mysql php8.2-xml php8.2-mbstring php8.2-curl php8.2-zip php8.2-intl php8.2-gd
```

By following these steps, you should have PHP 8.2.17 .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It appears that the PHP FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) was not installed. The command `php -v` shows that PHP CLI (Command Line Interface) is installed, but for PHP-FPM (which is necessary for web servers like Nginx or Apache in certain configurations), you need to install an additional package.

### Step 1: Install PHP-FPM

To install PHP-FPM for PHP 8.2, use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install -y php8.2-fpm
```

### Step 2: Start and Enable PHP-FPM Service

After installing PHP-FPM, you need to start the service and enable it to start at boot:

```
sudo systemctl start php8.2-fpm
sudo systemctl enable php8.2-fpm
````

### Verify the final setup:

```
php -v
sudo systemctl status php8.2-fpm
```
```
sudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php8.2
```

By following these steps, you should have both PHP 8.2.19 installed and running on your Ubuntu/Debian machine, including the PHP-FPM service.
