The word Polymorphic comes from Greek, and it means “many forms.” Like this, one model in our application can take many forms, meaning it can have more than one association. Imagine we are building an application with blogs, videos, polls, etc. A user can create a comment for any of these. Therefore, a Comment model might belong to Blogs, Videos, and Polls models.
